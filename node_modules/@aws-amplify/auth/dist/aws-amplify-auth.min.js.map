This is enabled by default when paramValidation is set\n   *     to `true`.\n   *   * **max** [Boolean] &mdash; Validates that a value meets the max\n   *     constraint.\n   *   * **pattern** [Boolean] &mdash; Validates that a string value matches a\n   *     regular expression.\n   *   * **enum** [Boolean] &mdash; Validates that a string value matches one\n   *     of the allowable enum values.\n   * @option options computeChecksums [Boolean] whether to compute checksums\n   *   for payload bodies when the service accepts it (currently supported\n   *   in S3 only)\n   * @option options convertResponseTypes [Boolean] whether types are converted\n   *     when parsing response data. Currently only supported for JSON based\n   *     services. Turning this off may improve performance on large response\n   *     payloads. Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options correctClockSkew [Boolean] whether to apply a clock skew\n   *     correction and retry requests that fail because of an skewed client\n   *     clock. Defaults to `false`.\n   * @option options s3ForcePathStyle [Boolean] whether to force path\n   *   style URLs for S3 objects.\n   * @option options s3BucketEndpoint [Boolean] whether the provided endpoint\n   *   addresses an individual bucket (false if it addresses the root API\n   *   endpoint). Note that setting this configuration option requires an\n   *   `endpoint` to be provided explicitly to the service constructor.\n   * @option options s3DisableBodySigning [Boolean] whether S3 body signing\n   *   should be disabled when using signature version `v4`. Body signing\n   *   can only be disabled when using https. Defaults to `true`.\n   *\n   * @option options retryDelayOptions [map] A set of options to configure\n   *   the retry delay on retryable errors. Currently supported options are:\n   *\n   *   * **base** [Integer] &mdash; The base number of milliseconds to use in the\n   *     exponential backoff for operation retries. Defaults to 100 ms for all\n   *     services except DynamoDB, where it defaults to 50ms.\n   *   * **customBackoff ** [function] &mdash; A custom function that accepts a retry count\n   *     and returns the amount of time to delay in milliseconds. The `base` option will be\n   *     ignored if this option is supplied.\n   * @option options httpOptions [map] A set of options to pass to the low-level\n   *   HTTP request. Currently supported options are:\n   *\n   *   * **proxy** [String] &mdash; the URL to proxy requests through\n   *   * **agent** [http.Agent, https.Agent] &mdash; the Agent object to perform\n   *     HTTP requests with. Used for connection pooling. Defaults to the global\n   *     agent (`http.globalAgent`) for non-SSL connections. Note that for\n   *     SSL connections, a special Agent object is used in order to enable\n   *     peer certificate verification. This feature is only available in the\n   *     Node.js environment.\n   *   * **connectTimeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after\n   *     failing to establish a connection with the server after\n   *     `connectTimeout` milliseconds. This timeout has no effect once a socket\n   *     connection has been established.\n   *   * **timeout** [Integer] &mdash; Sets the socket to timeout after timeout\n   *     milliseconds of inactivity on the socket. Defaults to two minutes\n   *     (120000).\n   *   * **xhrAsync** [Boolean] &mdash; Whether the SDK will send asynchronous\n   *     HTTP requests. Used in the browser environment only. Set to false to\n   *     send requests synchronously. Defaults to true (async on).\n   *   * **xhrWithCredentials** [Boolean] &mdash; Sets the \"withCredentials\"\n   *     property of an XMLHttpRequest object. Used in the browser environment\n   *     only. Defaults to false.\n   * @option options apiVersion [String, Date] a String in YYYY-MM-DD format\n   *   (or a date) that represents the latest possible API version that can be\n   *   used in all services (unless overridden by `apiVersions`). Specify\n   *   'latest' to use the latest possible version.\n   * @option options apiVersions [map<String, String|Date>] a map of service\n   *   identifiers (the lowercase service class name) with the API version to\n   *   use when instantiating a service. Specify 'latest' for each individual\n   *   that can use the latest available version.\n   * @option options logger [#write,#log] an object that responds to .write()\n   *   (like a stream) or .log() (like the console object) in order to log\n   *   information about requests\n   * @option options systemClockOffset [Number] an offset value in milliseconds\n   *   to apply to all signing times. Use this to compensate for clock skew\n   *   when your system may be out of sync with the service time. Note that\n   *   this configuration option can only be applied to the global `AWS.config`\n   *   object and cannot be overridden in service-specific configuration.\n   *   Defaults to 0 milliseconds.\n   * @option options signatureVersion [String] the signature version to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration). Possible values are:\n   *   'v2', 'v3', 'v4'.\n   * @option options signatureCache [Boolean] whether the signature to sign\n   *   requests with (overriding the API configuration) is cached. Only applies\n   *   to the signature version 'v4'. Defaults to `true`.\n   * @option options dynamoDbCrc32 [Boolean] whether to validate the CRC32\n   *   checksum of HTTP response bodies returned by DynamoDB. Default: `true`.\n   * @option options clientSideMonitoring [Boolean] whether to collect and\n   * publish this client's performance metrics of all its API requests.\n   */\n  constructor: function Config(options) {\n    if (options === undefined) options = {};\n    options = this.extractCredentials(options);\n\n    AWS.util.each.call(this, this.keys, function (key, value) {\n      this.set(key, options[key], value);\n    });\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * @!group Managing Credentials\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Loads credentials from the configuration object.

Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.

{AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithSAML} service operation. This operation\n * requires a `RoleArn` containing the ARN of the IAM trust policy for the\n * application for which credentials will be given, as well as a `PrincipalArn`\n * representing the ARN for the SAML identity provider. In addition, the\n * `SAMLAssertion` must be set to the token provided by the identity\n * provider. See {constructor} for an example on creating a credentials\n * object with proper `RoleArn`, `PrincipalArn`, and `SAMLAssertion` values.\n *\n * ## Refreshing Credentials from Identity Service\n *\n * In addition to AWS credentials expiring after a given amount of time, the\n * login token from the identity provider will also expire. Once this token\n * expires, it will not be usable to refresh AWS credentials, and another\n * token will be needed. The SDK does not manage refreshing of the token value,\n * but this can be done through a \"refresh token\" supported by most identity\n * providers. Consult the documentation for the identity provider for refreshing\n * tokens. Once the refreshed token is acquired, you should make sure to update\n * this new token in the credentials object's {params} property. The following\n * code will update the SAMLAssertion, assuming you have retrieved an updated\n * token from the identity provider:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials.params.SAMLAssertion = updatedToken;\n * ```\n *\n * Future calls to `credentials.refresh()` will now use the new token.\n *\n * @!attribute params\n *   @return [map] the map of params passed to\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithSAML}.

Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.
